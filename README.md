# Neighbourhood Police Data

A Python project to investigate the crime statistics in a user defined neighbourhood.

Uses data from the [**data.police.uk API**](https://data.police.uk/docs/).

The data was received in JSON format, cleaned using **Pandas**, and then displayed in a Jupyter Notebook using **Altair**.
